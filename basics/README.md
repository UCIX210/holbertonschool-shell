# **üõ†Requirements**
 * Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
 * All your scripts will be tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
 * All your scripts should be exactly two lines long (`$ wc -l file` should print 2)
 * All your files should end with a new line ([why?](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/18743/whats-the-point-in-adding-a-new-line-to-the-end-of-a-file/18789))
 * The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/bin/bash`
 * A `README.md` file at the root of the repo, containing a description of the repository
 * A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of this project, describing what each script is doing
 * You are not allowed to use backticks, `&&`, `||` or `;`
 * All your scripts must be executable. To make your file executable, use the `chmod` command: `chmod u+x file`. Later, we‚Äôll learn more about how to utilize this command.

# **üößTasks**
## **0. Create and setup your Git and GitHub account**
> **Repo:**
> * GitHub repository: `holbertonschool-zero_day`
> * File: `README.md`


## **1. Repo-session**
Create a new directory called `git` in your repo.
Make sure you include a not empty `README.md` in your directory:
* at the root of your repository
* AND in the directory `git`
And important part: **Make sure your commit and push your code to Github - otherwise the Checker will always fail.**
> **Repo:**
> * GitHub repository: `holbertonschool-zero_day`

## **2. Coding fury road**
For the moment we have an empty project directory containing only a `README.md`. It‚Äôs time to code!

* Create these directories at the root of your project: `bash`, `c`, `js`
* Create these empty files:
    * `c/c_is_fun.c`
    * `js/main.js`
    * `js/index.js`
* Create a file `bash/best` with these two lines inside: `#!/bin/bash` and `echo "Best"`
* Create a file `bash/school` with these two lines inside: `#!/bin/bash` and `echo "School"`
* Add all these new files to git
* Commit your changes (message: ‚ÄúStarting to code today, so cool‚Äù) and push to the remote server
> **Repo:**
> * GitHub repository: `holbertonschool-zero_day`
> * Directory: git
> * File: `bash/best, bash/school, c/c_is_fun.c, js/main.js, js/index.js`

## **3. Collaboration is the base of a company**
A branch is like a copy of your project. It‚Äôs used mainly for:

* adding a feature in development
* collaborating on the same project with other developers
* not breaking your entire repository
* not upsetting your co-workers

The purpose of a branch is to isolate your work from the main code base of your project and/or from your co-workers‚Äô work.

For this project, create a branch `update_script` and in this branch:

* Create an empty file named `bash/98`
* Update `bash/best` by replacing `echo "Best"` with `echo "Best School"`
* Update `bash/school` by replacing `echo "School"` with `echo "The school is open!"`
* Add and commit these changes (message: ‚ÄúMy personal work‚Äù)
* Push this new branch [Tips](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/pushing-commits-to-a-remote-repository)

Perfect! You did an amazing update in your project and it‚Äôs isolated correctly from the main branch.

Ho wait, your manager needs a quick fix in your project and it needs to be deployed now:

* Change branch to `main`
* Update the file `bash/best` by replacing `echo "Best"` with `echo "This School is so cool!"`
* Delete the directory `js`
* Commit your changes (message: ‚ÄúHot fix‚Äù) and push to the origin

Ouf, hot fix is done!
> **Repo:**
> * GitHub repository: `holbertonschool-zero_day`
> * Directory: git
> * File: `bash/best, bash/school, bash/98`

## **4. Collaboration: be up to date**
Of course, you can also work on the same branch as your co-workers and it‚Äôs best if you keep up to date with their changes.

For this task **‚Äì and only for this task ‚Äì** please update your file `README.md` in the main branch from GitHub.com. It‚Äôs the **only time** you are allowed to update and commit from GitHub interface.

After you have done that, in your terminal:

* Get all changes of the main branch locally (i.e. your `README.md` file will be updated)
* Create a new file `up_to_date` at the root of your directory and in it, write the git command line used
* Add `up_to_date` to git, commit (message: ‚ÄúHow to be up to date in git‚Äù), and push to the origin
> **Repo:**
> * GitHub repository: `holbertonschool-zero_day`
> * Directory: git
> * File: `README.md, up_to_date`

## **5. HAAA what did you do???**
Collaboration is cool, but not really when you update the same file at the same time‚Ä¶

To illustrate that, please merge the branch `update_script` to `main`: ‚ÄúCool, all my changes will be now part of the main branch, ready to be deployed!‚Äù

**HHHHHHHAAAAAAAA**

```
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in bash/best
```
As you can see, you have conflicts between two branches on the same file.

Your goal now is to resolve conflicts by using the version of the branch `update_script`, and push the result to the origin.

At the end, you should have all your work from the branch `update_script` (new file and two updated files) and all latest `main` commits (new files, delete folder, etc.), without conflicts.
> **Repo:**
> * GitHub repository: `holbertonschool-zero_day`
> * Directory: git

## **6. Never push too much**
Create a `.gitignore` file and define a rule to never push ~ files (generated by Emacs). [Tips](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore)
> **Repo:**
> * GitHub repository: `holbertonschool-zero_day`
> * Directory: git
> * File: `.gitignore`
